This project will be an ipad app using core data, uikit and possibly cocos2d. I used cocos2d on the iphone FlashCardSets that I developed but not sure at moment.
cocos2d and uikit worked pretty well in the iphone version but not sure how will it still plays together. 

Mainly do this to learn more about Apple's cocoa frameworks and objective-c.
